SIRENO-lite is a GEKKO-based dynamic optimization model for sizing and dispatching a hybrid system with wind, solar, wave, generator, battery, hydrogen production/storage, and potable water production/storage.

NOTE: Heavy AI assistance was used for developing the GUI, the docs, tests, reorganization, logo, and some additions to the base hybrid system optimization script.  Please use with caution and note the NOTICE and LICENSE file limitations on guarantees etc.  

Key features:

- Dynamic power balance with curtailment and dispatch controls.
- Hydrogen and potable water production modeled as flexible loads with storage reservoirs.
- Multiple objectives: total mass or cost per watt.
- Floating platform mass and cost derived from supported system mass.
- CSV-based resource and demand profiles.
- GUI for tuning inputs and visualizing results.
